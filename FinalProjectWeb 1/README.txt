This Project is intended to explore the use of WEBGL, blender and javascript. 

The goal of this project is to create a sense of realistic space inside the skybox 
created by WEBGL. I have included three different types of space ships from small to large. Besides the largest ship, the rest are placed in the space randomly. The smallest ships move the fastest.
